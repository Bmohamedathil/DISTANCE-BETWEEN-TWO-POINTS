# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import math as m
### Step 2:
Import I1,I2 
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 4: 
Distance = m.sqrt((I2[0]-I1[0])**2+(I2[1]-I1[1])**2)
### Step 5: 
Print the distance in two decimal
### PROGRAM:
```

import math as m
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
d=m.sqrt((l2[0]-l1[0])**2+(l2[1]-l1[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```
